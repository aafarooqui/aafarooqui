## You've reached Aadil!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am currently a 1st-year Biochemistry and Molecular Biology major *(yes, that's just one major)* at UC Davis.

Academically, currently very interested in organic chemistry. Come back some time later to check out what I'm doing.

I have experience in Python, Java, and C++. Also have web design proficiency (HTML + CSS, WordPress).
